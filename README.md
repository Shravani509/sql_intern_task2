This script demonstrates the creation and manipulation of a PLAYERS. It includes data insertion, updating, deletion, and handling of missing values. 
### 🔹 Features:
### Table Creation
PLAYERS and PLAYER tables are created to store player information (name, age, score).
### Data Insertion
Multiple records are inserted with specified scores.
A record with a missing score is added to test handling of NULL values.
### Data Update
Score for "RAHANE" is updated from 105 to 145.
### Data Deletion
Record with score 152 (i.e., SHIKHAR) is deleted.
### NULL Handling
A player ("GILL") is inserted without a score.
A query retrieves rows with NULL scores.
### Improved Table Design
A second table PLAYER is created with a default score of 0 to automatically handle missing scores.
